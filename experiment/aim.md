Vibration control is a set of technical means aimed to mitigate seismic impacts in building and non-building structures.

All seismic vibration control devices may be classified as passive and active where:

1. Passive control device (TMD, Base Isolator) imparts forces that are developed directly as a result of motion of structure (i.e., no actuator involved).
2. Active control devices incorporate real-time recoding instrumentation on the ground integrated with earthquake input processing equipment and actuators within the structure.
