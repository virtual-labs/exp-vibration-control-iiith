Start the experiment with default values of buildings' stiffness and ground motion(amount of vibration). Pause the experiment after a few cycles and 
observe the response of the structure with TMD and without the TMD for the same parameters.

NOTE: The parameters used in the experiment do not use actual data and hence have not been given units and are only used to observe variations in the simulation.

**Observation 1:**

Vary the stiffness of the buildings and note the corresponding variations in their responses.

**Observation 2:**

Vary the ground motion parameter and note the corresponding variations in the structures with TMD and without the TMD responses for the different values.
